When connecting your wallet to the application, it is possible to view the latest transactions made and send values through the Ethereum network on the blockchain. When sending the values, it is possible to write a keyword in the Keyword (GIF) field. Through Giphy's API, the keyword is associated with a similar gif and then displayed on the transaction card. It is also possible to send a message with the description of the transfer.
