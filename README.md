When connecting your wallet to the application, it is possible to view the latest transactions made and send values through the Ethereum network on the blockchain. When sending the values, it is possible to write a keyword in the Keyword (GIF) field. Through Giphy's API, the keyword is associated with a similar gif and then displayed on the transaction card. It is also possible to send a message with the description of the transfer.

## Problems Talked Down on
<!-- ü™° Accessibility: Giving web-based chat apps more power with the leverage of been accessed from any device with an internet connection, giving users greater flexibility and convenience.

ü™° No Download Required: Users don't need to download and install a separate app onto their device, saves storage space and reduces the time it takes to get started.

ü™° Cross-Platform Compatibility: TalkuTalku works across multiple platforms, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, making them more accessible to a wider range of users.

ü™° Easy Integration: Web-based chat apps can easily integrate with other web applications or services, such as social media platforms, email, and project management tools.

ü™° SEO Benefits: Web-based chat apps can help improve website traffic and visibility through search engine optimization (SEO), as they can be optimized for specific keywords.

to name a few... -->

- Lack of transparency: The application allows users to view their latest transactions made through the Ethereum network on the blockchain, which can increase transparency and provide greater visibility into one's transaction history.

- Limited functionality: By allowing users to send values and messages with description, the application provides additional functionality beyond what is typically offered by a regular wallet application.

- Boring or unengaging user experience: By associating keywords with GIFs through Giphy's API, the application adds an element of fun and whimsy to the transaction process, potentially making it more engaging for users.

- Difficulty in associating transfers with a specific context: By allowing users to include descriptions with their transfers, the application makes it easier to associate a transfer with a specific context (e.g. "rent payment" or "coffee with friends") rather than just a generic value transfer.
