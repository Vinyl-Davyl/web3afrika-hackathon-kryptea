When connecting your wallet to the application, it is possible to view the latest transactions made and send values through the Ethereum network on the blockchain. When sending the values, it is possible to write a keyword in the Keyword (GIF) field. Through Giphy's API, the keyword is associated with a similar gif and then displayed on the transaction card. It is also possible to send a message with the description of the transfer.

## Problems Talked Down on
- **Lack of transparency:** The application allows users to view their latest transactions made through the Ethereum network on the blockchain, which can increase transparency and provide greater visibility into one's transaction history.

- **Limited functionality:** By allowing users to send values and messages with description, the application provides additional functionality beyond what is typically offered by a regular wallet application.

- **Boring or unengaging user experience:** By associating keywords with GIFs through Giphy's API, the application adds an element of fun and whimsy to the transaction process, potentially making it more engaging for users.

- **Difficulty in associating transfers with a specific context:** By allowing users to include descriptions with their transfers, the application makes it easier to associate a transfer with a specific context (e.g. "rent payment" or "coffee with friends") rather than just a generic value transfer.

## Stack
This project was developed using the following technologies and resources:

[React](https://reactjs.org), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Giphy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Bunzz](https://www.bunzz.dev)


## Features

- [x] View latest transactions
- [x] Send values through Ethereum network on the blockchain
- [x] Write a keyword in the Keyword (GIF) field
- [x] Associate the keyword with similar GIF using Giphy's API
- [x] Display the associated GIF on the transaction card
- [x] Send a message with the description of the transfer

## Prerequisite     
1. Have MetaMask extension installed.
2. Have Node.js version 16^ installed.
3. Add and switch to the Polygon network on your MetaMask wallet(For already deployed smart contract on bunzz).

## Deploying your own kryptea-version smart contract on bunzz
- Create an account on the Bunz website and log in.
- Click on connect wallet to connect your MetaMask wallet to Bunzz. switch to the Polygon network on your MetaMask wallet.
- Click on create Dapp. Give your Dapp any name of your choice. Then click Next.
- Select polygon Mumbai Testnet(For the purpose of test case as compared to Mainnet) as the network name. Then  click Next.
- Go to prepared templates. You will see a list of already written templates/smart contracts awaiting deployment.
- Using the first template named simple Token. Click on use the template.
- Give your Token a name(any name of choice), and a unique symbol. for example, if the token name is ‚ÄòKryptea Token‚Äô, then the symbol can be ‚ÄòKT‚Äô.
- Before you deploy, you need to have enough tokens in your wallet, otherwise, your contract will not be deployed to the blockchain. Go to polygon faucet and get free Testnet to use for deployment.
- Click on deploy. your MetaMask wallet will pop up on your screen for you to confirm the transaction.
- Click on back to dashboard and Copy your contract ABI and contract address.
- To verify your transaction, paste your contract address on PolygonScan Testnet
